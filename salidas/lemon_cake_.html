<h2>Ingredientes</h2>
<ul>
<li>4.0 cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li>2.0 cup almond flour </li>
<li>6.0 tsp 1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
<li>2.0 tsp kosher salt</li>
<li>8.0  eggs</li>
<li>2.0 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
<li>2.0 cup granulated sugar</li>
<li>2.0 tsp vanilla extract</li>
<li>4.0  grated zest of 1 lemon</li>
<li>2.0 cup fresh lemon juice</li>
<li>  powdered sugar, for dusting</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instrucciones</h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat your oven to 350Â°F. Use your hands to butter the bottom and sides of an 8 in cake pan, then line the bottom with a circle of parchment paper. </li>
<li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, ground almonds, baking powder, and salt.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, whisk the eggs until the whites and yolks are fully combined. Add the olive oil and granulated sugar and whisk until the sugar is dissolved (test by rubbing some of the mixture between two fingers). Whisk in the vanilla, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Whisk in the flour mixture.</li>
<li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan, being sure to use a rubber spatula to get it all out of the bowl. Hold the pan just a little bit above the counter and then drop it on the counter to eliminate any air bubbles.</li>
<li>Bake until the cake is beautifully golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Transfer the cake, still in its pan, to a wire rack and let it cool completely. Once cool, use a dinner knife to loosen the edges of the cake from the pan and invert it onto your work surface (you might need to give the pan a little whack). Peel off and discard the parchment. Invert the cake one more time onto a serving platter so the flat side is down and the domed side is up.</li>
<li>Just before serving, dust the cake with powdered sugar.</li>
